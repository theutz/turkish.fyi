# Postpositions

There are a few sub-divisions of postpositions worth discussing:

- Bare postpositions
    - complements are non-case-marked or genitive-marked
    - complements are dative-marked
    - complements are ablative marked
- Posessive-marked postpositions
    - spatial
    - non-spatial or abstract
